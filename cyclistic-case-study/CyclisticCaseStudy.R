#=====================
# STEP 1: COLLECT DATA
#=====================
# # Upload Divvy datasets (csv files) here
q1_2019 <- read_csv("Divvy_Trips_2019_Q1.csv")
q1_2020 <- read_csv("Divvy_Trips_2020_Q1.csv")


#====================================================
# STEP 2: WRANGLE DATA AND COMBINE INTO A SINGLE FILE
#====================================================
# Compare column names each of the files
# While the names don't have to be in the same order, they DO need to match perfectly before we can use a command to join them into one file
colnames(q1_2019)
colnames(q1_2020)

# Rename columns  to make them consistent with q1_2020

(q1_2019 <- rename(q1_2019

                   ,end_station_name = to_station_name
                   ,end_station_id = to_station_id
                   ,member_casual = usertype
))

# Inspect the dataframes and look for incongruencies
str(q1_2019)
str(q1_2020)

# Convert ride_id and rideable_type to character so that they can stack correctly
q1_2019 <-  mutate(q1_2019, ride_id = as.character(ride_id)
                   ,rideable_type = as.character(rideable_type)) 

# Stack individual quarter's data frames into one big data frame
all_trips <- bind_rows(q1_2019, q1_2020)

# Remove lat, long, birthyear, and gender fields as this data was dropped in 2020
all_trips <- all_trips %>%  
  select(-c(start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, birthyear, gender,  "tripduration"))






#======================================================
# STEP 3: CLEAN UP AND ADD DATA TO PREPARE FOR ANALYSIS
#======================================================
# Inspect the new table that has been created
colnames(all_trips)  #List of column names
nrow(all_trips)  #How many rows are in data frame?
dim(all_trips)  #Dimensions of the data frame?
head(all_trips)  #See the first 6 rows of data frame.  Also tail(all_trips)
str(all_trips)  #See list of columns and data types (numeric, character, etc)
summary(all_trips)  #Statistical summary of data. Mainly for numerics

# There are a few problems that needs to be fixed:
# (1) Need to consolidate member_casual column from four to two values.
# (2) Add additional columns of data -- day, month, year
# (3) Calculate field for length of ride since the 2020Q1 data did not have the "tripduration" column.
# (4) There are some rides where tripduration shows up as negative -- delete these rides.


# See how many observations fall under each usertype
table(all_trips$member_casual)

# Reassign to the desired values
all_trips <-  all_trips %>% 
  mutate(member_casual = recode(member_casual
                                ,"Subscriber" = "member"
                                ,"Customer" = "casual"))

# Check to make sure the proper number of observations were reassigned
table(all_trips$member_casual)

# Add columns that list the date, month, day, and year of each ride

all_trips$date <- as.Date(all_trips$started_at) #The default format is yyyy-mm-dd

# Add a "ride_length" calculation to all_trips (in seconds)
all_trips$ride_length <- difftime(all_trips$ended_at,all_trips$started_at)

# Inspect the structure of the columns
str(all_trips)

# Convert "ride_length" to numeric
is.factor(all_trips$ride_length)
all_trips$ride_length <- as.numeric(as.character(all_trips$ride_length))

# Let's visualize the number of rides by rider type
